Hi! Welcome to my repo! I am using this repo to document my progress with coding. 

Please note that the folders labelled "A" at the end of their numbers contain codes that come with the DFRobot pdf, with minimal changes.
The codes lin folders labelled "B" are my own version of the code for the exercises and assignments by DFRobot. 
It also documents my experimentation with the code to for other tasks that I was curious about. 

All the notes were written for myself to refresh my memory and my for me to remind myself of the thought process for the code.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions!
